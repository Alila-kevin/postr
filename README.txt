This is a demo blogging application that allows users to post text entries,
images, quotes, links, conversations, videos, and audio. It is developed as an
example Zend Framework application to be used during presentations.

Installation
============

This application requires that you have Zend Framework on your include_path. If
you do not yet have Zend Framework then you can get it from one of the following
sources:

 * Official Release:
   http://framework.zend.com/download/latest

 * Subversion; use either the current trunk or the 1.10 release branch:
   svn checkout http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend

   svn checkout http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/branches/release-1.10/library/Zend

 * PEAR:
   pear channel-discover pear.zfcampus.org
   pear install zfcampus/zf

Once Zend Framework is installed, configure your server's document root to be
the "public" directory within this application.
